# odin-recipes

Odin project's recipes with HTML
A simple HTML page with multiple links to different recipes that I found online.

# what I learned

1. I learned to add images to a simple HTML page
2. Learned to use unordered list tag 'ul' to add ingredients for the given recipe
3. Learned to use oredered list 'ol' to add an ordered list of steps needed to finish the recipe
