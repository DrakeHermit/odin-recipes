  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pan-frying or pan-searing is one of the best ways to cook salmon fillets. It's quick, easy, and gives the fish that
  perfect crispy, crunchy skin. A simple pan-fried salmon is the secret to a flavorful and healthy weeknight dinner in 30
  minutes or less.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to cook</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, add butter or oil and the salmon fillets skin-side
    down. Heat to medium-high and cook for about 5 or 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gently use a wide spatula to flip the fish and cook skin-side up for 3 to 5 minutes or until done. Finish with a little
    squeeze of lemon.</li>
