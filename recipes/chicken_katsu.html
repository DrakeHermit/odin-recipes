  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Air fryer chicken katsu that is crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce is a little bit sweet,
  a little bit tangy, and complements the chicken perfectly. Serve over rice if desired.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sherry</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, sliced in half horizontally</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to cook</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare sauce: Whisk ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, sherry, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic together in a bowl until
    sugar has dissolved. Set katsu sauce aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, lay chicken pieces on a clean work surface. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place beaten eggs in a flat dish or shallow bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a second flat dish. Dredge chicken pieces in
    egg and then in bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Dredge chicken pieces in
    egg and then in bread crumbs. Repeat by dredging chicken in egg and then bread crumbs again, pressing down so the bread
    crumbs stick to the chicken.</li>
    <li>Air fry for 10 minutes. Flip chicken pieces over using a spatula and spray the tops with nonstick cooking spray. Cook
    for 8 minutes more. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice. Serve with katsu sauce.</li>
  </ol>
